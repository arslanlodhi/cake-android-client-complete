# cake-android-client-complete

Here is the second solution with complete revamp, I have use Android Architecture components and MVVM to make it clean.


# Libraries I might have used
Its a sensitive Project as per the requirement,i was instructed not to use third party libraries, But if i have got the chance to use 3rd party libraries. I might have used below 3rd Party Libraries.

1. Glide {for image loading and caching}
2. GSON {For Json serlization/deserialization}
3. RxJava for Observer/Subscription Pattern 


# Explaination
Its my second submission where i have revamed the architecture freely, User Android Architecture Components like LiveData,ViewModel DataBinding etc, And I also used Dagger 2 for dependency injection. Below you can see project hierarchy.
